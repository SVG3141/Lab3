# GGR472 Lab 3: Simple expressions and events with Mapbox GL JS

This repository contains JavaScript files and resources to help you learn about using the Mapbox GL JS library to filter data, update paint properties, and handle events on interactive maps.

## Repository Contents

- `index.html`: HTML file to render the map and include necessary dependencies
- `style.css`: CSS file for positioning the map interface
- `script-expressions.js`: JavaScript file containing code for filtering data and updating paint properties, classifying properties, and amp controls
- `Data folder`: Toronto Rinks GeoJSON data for demonstration purposes

## Objectives

This code is provided to help with learning the following concepts:

1. **Classifying data/symbology**
   - Use data and conditional expressions to filter data layers on the map
   - Update paint properties dynamically based on filtered data

2. **Handling Events with Mapbox GL JS**
   - Implement interactive features such as clicking on map features
   - Display data attributes in pop-ups when users interact with map features
   - Change the appearance of map features in response to user interaction
   

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine (<>Code > Download ZIP)
2. Set the JavaScript source to the required `.js` file and update the public access token
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the map
4. Experiment with the code to further your understanding
